This is my solutions and stuff for the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course about [HTTP Servers in Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers).

It's a cool learning platform for backend.
I used [ThePrimeagen's](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen) discount [code](https://boot.dev/primeyt) but there are other discounts around there.
I'm not sponsored, I just appreciate their work.
