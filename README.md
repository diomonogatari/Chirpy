This is my solutions and stuff for the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course about [HTTP Servers in Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers).

It's a cool learning platform for backend.
I used [ThePrimeagen's](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen) discount [code](https://boot.dev/primeyt) but there are other discounts around there.  
I'm **not sponsored**, I just appreciate their work.

## .env Specifications

To run the project, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Database configuration
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_URL="YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details.
